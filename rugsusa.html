                            <p class="work_box-text-para">Rugs USA is an ecommerce store primarily focused on selling high quality rugs at the best prices. Rugs USA provides a wide range and variety of sizes, designs, and weaves made for any customer. They provide many features to answer all questions that customers might have when purchasing a rug - photos, how it would look, inspirations. In addition to rugs, Rugs USA also sells a variety of lightning options to pair them with. Customers can share photos and reviews that are updated to the website to give other customers inspirations.</p>

                            <p class="work_box-text-para">As a front end web developer, my main tasks were to upkeep the Rugs USA website and update it whenever new features, sales, or events occurred. However, I also worked as part of the design team and I was tasked with redesigning the rugs catalog page. The catalogs page was barebone without any real structure and ease of use.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p class="work_box-text-para">A huge issue that the analytics team brought to attention was the amount of cart abandonment. Customers would leave the website or back out of purchasing a rug because they were unsure how the rug will look, fit, or how difficult it would be to keep clean. In response to this, I spearheaded my own solo project, Rugs 101 - a buyer’s guide for new and existing customers who need more information or guidance when purchasing a rug. This guide would cover all the basic and extra information that buyer’s have questions about.</p>

                            <p class="work_box-text-para">I laid out the goals that I needed to fulfill based on chronological order:</p>
                            <ol class="work_box-text-ordered">
                                <li class="work_box-text-li"><span class="bold">Rugs Catalog</span>: There was an overwhelming amount of filters with no separation or categories, which resulted in a large amount of scrolling and searching. Each rug came with a preview of its colors but lacked any other important information. I focused on creating a better filter system while adding more information for the rug preview.</li>
                                <li class="work_box-text-li"><span class="bold">Rug Full</span>: When users clicked into a rug within the rugs catalog, they were brought to the full view of the rug. This page lacked the necessary information and structure. There was also a lack of features that could help the user feel confident when buying the rug. There were a lot of features and sections I wanted to add within the rug full view page.</li>
                                <li class="work_box-text-li"><span class="bold">Rugs 101</span>: Cart abandonment was a huge issue and knowing the reason behind the occurrence was a good first step.

                        <p class="work_box-text-para">Rugs USA’s catalog page featured a long list of filters that took up space from the main rug viewing experience. Using the filter system was a pain because of how unorganized they were in addition to the obscene amount of options. For the rug preview cards, there was a lack of useful information that is crucial to modern day online shopping such as shipping time/prices, reviews, and sale indications.</p>

                        <p class="work_box-text-para">For the filter, I first categorized each option based on its relatability. This created an easier way for users to find the filter they’re looking for with ease. Then I moved the filter to the top of the rugs list to ensure that the rug preview cards had the full width of the screen. Because of how important the images of the rugs are, I wanted to give it as much space as possible.</p>

                        <p class="work_box-text-para">Each rug comes with its own variations and so I added a way to preview each of the color choices for each rug view card. Reviews are crucial to a customer, especially online as evident from platforms such as Amazon and Yelp. It can decide whether a customer buys it or avoids it, so it was necessary to show it under the rug’s name. In a time of quick deliveries and mass shipments, the importance of adding “Fast & Free Shipping” to all rugs it applies to was an easy way of answering every customer’s worry about shipment time and price.</p>

I included all the information on the rug preview from the catalogs page, but with specificity. For the main information that Rugs USA provides, I included a sale timer, every color of the rug, each shape that the rug can be made into, every sizing with their prices and sale prices, and shipment estimation. There are other useful links such as “You might also like” and “Your recently viewed” to provide a quick way to access other recommendations and previously interested items.</p>

Rugs 101 is an all-in-one buyer’s guide for new and existing customers who have questions or are unsure about their purchase. Rugs 101 would feature information regarding:</p>

Each section goes over in full detail of their respective topic, including images and graphics that help visualize each topic.

After receiving analytics, we received a lot of activity and views on our Rugs 101 guide in conjunction with rug purchases, decreasing overall cart abandonment by 23%.</p>
