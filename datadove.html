                            <p class="work_box-text-para">Data Dove is a premium Discord group with the purpose of helping its members secure and purchase upcoming hype products. Using bots and insider information, members are able to prepare themselves and use programs to checkout as soon as an item drops. Cook groups are becoming a well known community, but can be intimidating to new users. Data Dove focuses on helping complete beginners dive into the world cook groups.</p>

                <!--Goals-->
                <div class="work_box" id="healco_goals">
                    <div class="work_box-text">
                        <div class="work_box-text-contain">
                            <h2 class="work_box-text-header">Goals</h2>
                            <p class="work_box-text-para">Due to Data Dove being a completely new group, it needed a logo and website to build its brand and recognition. Since Data Dove is purely a Discord based group, the website was an important gateway for potentially interested viewers to know the purpose of Data Dove. It was also going to be the only way for new users to gain access to the group.</p>

                        <div class="work_box-text-contain">
                            <p class="work_box-text-para">I focused on the technical aspect of Data Dove - such as website, payment setup through Stripe and Launchpass, Discord server features and permissions - as well as the design - logo, promotional video, advertisement, and fliers . The other cofounder worked on the social networking and promotional aspects of Data Dove, as he already had a following of interested members. We also wanted to become affiliated with different cook groups and well known bots providers.</p>

                            <h2 class="work_box-text-header">Logo Design</h2>
                            <p class="work_box-text-para">With a name like Data Dove, it was obvious to go with a bird-like design for the main logo. Using the word “data” and Data Dove being an online somewhat-tech group, I decided to go with a low poly-esque direction for the bird. I believe low poly graphics are widely used in tech related designs and that felt like a great way to represent the “data” part of Data Dove. I used a high contrast of dark navy and bright pink to bring a neon tech vibe to the logo.</p>

                        <p class="work_box-text-para">For the website, I went with the same color scheme as the logo but added more complementary colors and shades to give a more diverse and vibrant look. Similarly, I kept the dark neon tech vibe throughout the whole website and made sure every component blended well with each other to create a smooth website look and experience. I kept in mind the user experience and mobile responsiveness as I developed my design into a functioning website.</p>

                            I integrated Stripe and Launchpass onto the website which allows users to purchase their membership right on the landing page. This provided new members immediate access and a direct flow from the website to the entire Discord.

                        <p class="work_box-text-para">After going through a beta of Data Dove, we were able to have a steady flow of members looking to get into the cook group world. We created a community where members learn together and from each other with the information that we post daily, while also giving them the chance to experience firsthand quick checkouts and securing purchases using the bots that we were affiliated with. We believe every person needs a great place to start, and Data Dove is a great starting point for new Cookers.</p>
